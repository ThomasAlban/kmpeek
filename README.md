# kmpeek

An in-progress 3D KMP editor for Mario Kart Wii, written in Rust using the [bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) game engine. The goal is for it to be the ultimate KMP editor for Mario Kart Wii, taking inspiration from the good parts of others (such as [Lorenzi's](https://github.com/hlorenzi/kmp-editor), [KMP Cloud](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/KMP_Cloud)). It is currently unusable as a KMP editor but hopefully will have its first release soon!

## Contributing

Contributing to this project is very much welcome! If you want to contribute, talk to me on discord or open an issue so we can discuss it. I will also try my best to open issues where I highlight things I'd like help with. Note: since this project is in the early stages of development, my commits are often disorganised and lots of the fundamental code structure is often changed.

## How to build

Have Rust installed and the repository cloned, then run `cargo run -r` in the directory (remove `-r` if you want debug mode rather than release mode).  
Expect it to take a few minutes to compile for the first time (because it will need to download all the packages and compile them), but after that it should be pretty quick.
